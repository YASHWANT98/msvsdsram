## Memory Design Complier

 Legato Memory Solution is the integrated solution for memory design, verification, and characterization from Cadence. It provides one platform for all memory design, verification, and characterization needs.
 
 It is a solution that consists of three environment cockpits: cell design, array and compiler verification, and memory characterization1. With the cell design cockpit, we can design the bitcell and get Monte Carlo variation analysis1. With the array and compiler verification cockpit, we can verify the memory array and compiler functionality and performance1. With the memory characterization cockpit, we can generate accurate memory models and reports. The Legato Memory Solution uses common engines such as Spectre, Liberate, and Voltus to ensure consistency and accuracy across the design flow

Virtuoso Liberate MX is a memory characterization solution from Cadence that extends the standard cell and I/O library characterization capabilities to cover larger macro blocks such as memory (SRAM, ROM etc) and custom cores

The inputs taken by Virtuoso Liberate MX are:

* The memory netlist, which is the SPICE description of the memory circuit.
* The memory configuration file, which is the XML file that specifies the memory architecture, modes, features, and pins.
* The characterization setup file, which is the TCL file that specifies the characterization parameters, such as the models, views, corners, conditions, and options.
* The characterization library, which is the library that contains the standard cell and I/O models that are used by the memory circuit.

The Virtuoso Liberate MX characterizing tool can output 

* library files that contain the timing, noise, and power models of memory and custom cores1. These library files can be used for various design and analysis tools. * * The tool can also output variation models and library validation reports

## Prelayout Simulation

### 6T SRAM Cell

A generic SRAM cell is made up of six MOSFETs, and is often called a 6T SRAM cell. Each bit in the cell is stored on four transistors that form two cross-coupled inverters. This storage cell has two stable states which are used to denote 0 and 1. Two additional access transistors serve to control the access to a storage cell during read and write operations. 

#### SRAM Cell Circuit Schematic:
  
This is a achematic of the 6T SRAM cell. Here, the 4 MOSFETs M0, M1, M4, M5 are cross-coupled to form the latch like component to store a bit. This bit can be read or write through the transister M2 and M3 using write line and bit line.

#### SRAM Cell Write Operation :

The bit to be written and its inversion are loaded onto the bit line and inverted bit line respectfully. Once the write signal goes HIGH, the access transistor are enabled and the bit value on the bit line is written upon the previously stored bit.

#### SRAM Cell Read Operation :

Unlike write operation, Read operation is a bit tricky in SRAM cell. This is becuase, before enabling the access transistors, the bit-lines are first pre-charged to high logic. Depending upon the bit store, one of the bit-line is pulled back to logic low when the access transistors are enabled.

### SRAM Stability Analysis: 

The conventional method to measure SRAM stability is static stability analysis, which measures the stability of SRAM by measuring the magnitude of static noise tolerance

Static Noise Margin: 

Static noise margin (SNM) is a key figure of merit for an SRAM cell. It can be extracted by nesting the largest possible square in the two voltage transfer curves     (VTC) of the two CMOS inverters involved. The SNM is defined as the side-length of the square (i.e. diagonal-length), given in volts. When an external DC noise is     larger than the SNM, the state of the SRAM cell can change and data is lost.

 1. Hold SNM:

   Hold Static Noise Margin (HSNM) determines the stability of an SRAM cell in the standby mode. The HSNM is determined by the length of a side of the largest square      that can be inscribed inside the smaller of two lobes

![](images/Hold_SNM_Ciruit.png)

![](images/Hold_SNM.png)


2. Read SNM: 

  Read Static Noise Margin (SNM) is a measure of the stability of an SRAM cell during a read operation. The read margin is directly proportional to the cell ratio       and increases with the increase in value of the pull-up ratio

![](images/Read_SNM_Circuit.png)

![](images/Read_SNM.png)

![](images/Read_SNM_Calculation.png)

SNM<sub>Low</sub>  = 0.243V 

SNM<sub>High</sub> = 0.222V

Read SNM = min(SNM<sub>Low</sub> , SNM<sub>High</sub> ) = 0.222V

3. N Curve :

   N-curve is a metric used for inline testers. It gives information for both voltage and current, and in addition it has no voltage scaling delimiter as found in SNM    approach. It also has the complete information about the SRAM stability and also write ability in a single plot. N-curve can be further extended to power metrics      in  which both the voltage and current information are taken into consideration to provide better stability analysis of the SRAM cell.

  * Static Voltage Noise Margin (SVNM): 

    It is the voltage difference between point A and B. It indicates the maximum tolerable DC noise voltage of the cell before its content changes.
  
    SVNM = 572.3mV

  * Static Current Noise Margin (SINM):

    It is the additional current information provided by the N-curve, namely the peak current located between point A and B. It can also be used to characterize the       cell read stability.

    SINM = 129.41uA

Note: For better read stability, SVNM and SINM must be high value.

  * Write-Trip Voltage (WTV): 

    It is the voltage difference between point C and B. It is the voltage drop needed to flip the internal node “1” of the cell with both the bit-lines clamped to VDD.
  
    WTV = 889.9mV

  * Write-Trip Current (WTI): 
  
    It is the negative current peak between point C and B. It is the amount of current needed to write the cell when both bit-lines are kept at VDD.
  
    WTI = -58.17uA
  

### Precharge Circuit 

A pre-charge circuit for SRAM is a circuit that reduces the active current consumption and bit line peak current by decreasing the number of bit lines to be pre-charged at any one time during a pre-charge cycle

Shown below is the schematic and simulation of a Precharge Circuit.

### Sense Amplifier 

The function of sense amplifier is to amplify the very small analog differential voltage between the bit-lines during a read operation and provide a digital output. This effectively reduces the time required for the read operation, as each individual cell need not fully discharge the bit line.

* if bit > bit_bar, output is 1
* if bit < bit_bar, output is 0

Shown below is the schematic and simulation of a Sense Amplifier.

### Tristate Buffer

Tri-state buffer is a normal buffer with an extra enable input. Whenever, the enable input is high, tri-state buffer behaves as a normal buffer, otherwise it will either give high impedance or low logic as output.

Shown below is the schematic and simulation of a Tri-State Buffer.

### D flipflop

### Write Driver

The bit-lines are pre-charged to Vdd during the read operation. If a write operation occurs, one of the bit-lines should driven back to low logic before enabling access transistors. Write drivers are used for this purpose.

1-bit SRAM comprises of a 6T SRAM cell, a sense amplifier, a write driver and a pre-charge circuit.
